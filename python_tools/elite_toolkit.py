## Overview
This educational toolkit demonstrates various cybersecurity attack techniques for defensive training purposes. It's designed to help security professionals, students, and researchers understand how malicious software operates so they can better defend against it.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
This toolkit is for **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**. It is designed for:
- Cybersecurity education and training
- Red team exercises in controlled environments  
- Security research and analysis
- Defensive strategy development

**DO NOT USE FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES**

## Components

### 1. Educational Crypter (`educational_crypter_demo.py`)
Demonstrates how malware protects itself from analysis:
- Runtime encryption simulation
- Anti-debugging techniques
- Code obfuscation methods
- Packer/unpacker concepts

### 2. Educational Binder (`educational_binder_demo.py`)  
Shows how malware combines multiple payloads:
- File binding techniques
- Resource embedding
- Multi-stage payload delivery
- Steganographic concepts

### 3. Educational Stealer (`educational_stealer_demo.py`)
Demonstrates data collection techniques:
- Browser data extraction simulation
- System information gathering
- Credential harvesting concepts
- Sensitive file identification

### 4. Educational RAT (`educational_rat_server.py` / `educational_rat_client.py`)
Shows remote access tool functionality:
- Command and control communication
- Remote system access simulation
- Data exfiltration concepts
- Persistence mechanisms

## Usage

### Basic Demonstration
```bash
# Run individual demonstrations
python3 educational_crypter_demo.py
python3 educational_binder_demo.py  
python3 educational_stealer_demo.py

# RAT demonstration (run server first, then client)
python3 educational_rat_server.py &
python3 educational_rat_client.py
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
from elite_toolkit import EliteToolkitBuilder

# Create complete toolkit
builder = EliteToolkitBuilder()
builder.create_toolkit_bundle("my_security_training")
```

## Educational Value

- Security research in controlled environments
- Red team exercises with proper authorization

### ❌ Prohibited Uses  
- Unauthorized access to systems
- Data theft or privacy violations
- Distribution of actual malware
- Any illegal cybercriminal activity

## Installation

```bash
# Clone or download the toolkit
git clone <repository-url>
cd educational_toolkit

# No additional dependencies required
python3 educational_crypter_demo.py
```

## Contributing

If you're an educator or security researcher, contributions are welcome:
